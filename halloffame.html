    <p>Family<br>I am an only child, but I was born in a big family. My grandmother has three children. They have very good relations. One of them is my father. I have three cousins. My parents divorced when I was very young, and I lived with my father all the time, but every summer I went to stay with my mother for a few days. My brother was born this year, but we are half-parents</p>

  <p>Introduce<br>I grew up in China, I like photography very much, and I am very fortunate. My family likes to travel, so I have provided many photography opportunities. I held a personal photo exhibition for the first time in the sixth grade of elementary school and boarded it. Local newspapers and TV. Later, with the help of my cousin, I came to the United States and went to high school. I was exposed to rugby, fitness, American culture, and a completely different ideology. Now I am going to apply for university. I hope to learn hotel management. And made changes to the Chinese hotel industry after graduation.</p>
